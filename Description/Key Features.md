## Key Features

### Journey and Checkpoints
- **Journey Structure:** Goals are broken down into smaller steps or sub-goals, visually represented as a series of checkpoints or stairs. Users can see how much they have accomplished and what remains.
- **Progress Visualization:** A clear visual representation of progress, like stairs, with an image at the top symbolizing goal completion.

### User Interaction
- **Goal Clarification Prompts:** The app asks users why they want to complete a task and what will happen after completing it, helping them better visualize their motivations.
- **Subgoal Creation:** Goals are divided into very small sub-goals. Users are nudged with thoughtful questions like, "What action towards your goal can you take right now?" and can write these down as sub-goals.
- **Status Updates:** Users are asked about their goal status two to three times a week. This includes documenting problems faced, tasks completed or not, and any progress made, without overwhelming the user. Regular updates come with rewards.
